- Create an instance from the NithyLibrary AMI
- Attach the Elastic IP to this instance
- Add inbound security group rule to accept traffic from port 80. The security group name
  can be found in the EC2 instance details.
- Attach NithyLibraryIndex volume to this instance. Steps to do this as follows.
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html
	lsblk - This will list all the attached volumes
	sudo mkdir /data
	sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig
	vi /etc/fstab
	add the following line to fstab file
	sudo file -s /dev/xvda1

	Assuming that you find /dev/xvda1 to have UUID de9a1ccd-a2dd-44f1-8be8-0123456abcdef, you would add the following entry to /etc/fstab to mount an ext4 file system at mount point /data:

	UUID=de9a1ccd-a2dd-44f1-8be8-0123456abcdef       /data   ext4    defaults,nofail        0       2
	sudo mount -a
